* keyboard control
* better mobile support (don't rely on mouse hover effect)
* detect when mouse leaves canvas, and set mousepos to null
* autosize to fill the browser window
* webpack
* add a license
* networked multiplayer (firebase?)
* option to turn off board lines. it looks slicker that way
* option to change camera angle
* try drawing board lines with GL_LINES, see if it will look sharper?
* some kind of (optional) animation when you reset the game. pieces fade out or sink through the board or something
