bugs:
* the 'black/white wins' message doesn't show up on ipad?

features:
* keyboard control
* better mobile support (don't rely on mouse hover effect)
* update canvas width on resize
* add a license
* networked multiplayer (firebase?)
* option to turn off board lines. it looks slicker that way
* try drawing board lines with GL_LINES, see if it will look sharper?
* some kind of (optional) animation when you reset the game. pieces fade out or sink through the board or something
* option to throw the board if you lose (animate board and pieces flying)
* something faster than webpack/babel/etc. for developing. probably not possible because of JSX...
